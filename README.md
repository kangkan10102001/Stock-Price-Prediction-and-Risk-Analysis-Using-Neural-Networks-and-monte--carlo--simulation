Stock Price Prediction and Risk Analysis Using Neural Networks and Monte Carlo Simulation
Overview
This project aims to predict stock price movements using a neural network model and assess risk using Monte Carlo simulations. We analyze historical stock data to predict future prices and run numerous iterations of probabilistic models to estimate future price distributions and associated risks.
Features
Neural Network Stock Prediction: A neural network model built using Python to predict future stock prices based on historical data.
Monte Carlo Simulation: A simulation that runs multiple iterations to project the potential range of stock prices and assess risks involved.
Dataset Used: Apple Inc. (AAPL) stock price dataset.
Risk Analysis: Evaluation of financial and operational risks by simulating future stock price movements.
Technologies Used
Python: For model development and analysis.
TensorFlow/Keras: For building and training the neural network model.
Pandas: For data processing and manipulation.
NumPy: For numerical calculations in Monte Carlo simulations.
Matplotlib/Seaborn: For visualizing results and model performance.
Results
Neural Network Performance: Visualized graphs of model predictions vs. actual stock prices.
Monte Carlo Simulation: Distributions of potential future stock prices and corresponding risk metrics.
